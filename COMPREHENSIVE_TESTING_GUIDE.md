## üß™ Automated Test Script

Run the automated test script to verify API functionality:

```bash
# 1. Get your user ID from Supabase Dashboard
# Go to: Authentication > Users > Copy UUID

# 2. Update the test script
nano test-journal-system.js
# Replace 'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE' with your actual user ID

# 3. Run the test
node test-journal-system.js
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ Entry created successfully!
‚úÖ Found X entries
‚úÖ Entry fetched successfully!
‚úÖ Entry updated successfully!
‚úÖ Search found X matching entries
‚úÖ Stats fetched successfully!
‚úÖ Entry deleted successfully!

üéâ All tests passed successfully!
```

## üîç Database Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify data:

```sql
-- Check all tables have data
SELECT 'profiles' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM profiles
UNION ALL
SELECT 'journal_entries', COUNT(*) FROM journal_entries
UNION ALL
SELECT 'symptoms', COUNT(*) FROM symptoms
UNION ALL
SELECT 'conversations', COUNT(*) FROM conversations
UNION ALL
SELECT 'messages', COUNT(*) FROM messages;

-- Verify journal entries with moods
SELECT
  user_id,
  entry_date,
  mood_rating,
  LENGTH(content) as content_length,
  created_at
FROM journal_entries
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check average mood per user
SELECT
  user_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_entries,
  AVG(mood_rating) as avg_mood,
  MIN(entry_date) as first_entry,
  MAX(entry_date) as latest_entry
FROM journal_entries
GROUP BY user_id;

-- Verify symptoms tracking
SELECT
  user_id,
  symptom_date,
  symptom_name,
  severity,
  created_at
FROM symptoms
ORDER BY symptom_date DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check RLS policies are active
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Database not configured"
**Solution:** Check `.env` file has correct Supabase credentials

### Issue: "User not found"
**Solution:** Complete onboarding flow to create profile

### Issue: RLS policy denies access
**Solution:** Verify user_id matches authenticated user

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution:** Check backend allows frontend origin in cors config

### Issue: Stats show 0 even with entries
**Solution:** Check date formats are YYYY-MM-DD, verify timezone handling
